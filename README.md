# Prison-Breaks
This was a guided project from Dataquest where I learned the following :
    Obtain real data from the internet and prepare it for analysis
    Analyze the data using Python
    Author our first portfolio project in Jupyter Notebook, to share code and communicate results
  
  
I then had to answer some questions such as:
    In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
    In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?


I also got some concepts of Jupyter such as:
• Type and execute code
• Add accompanying text to our code (including math equations)
• Add visualizations
Jupyter can run in a browser and be used to create compelling data science projects that we can
easily share with others.
•
A notebook is a file created using Jupyter notebooks. We can easily share and distribute
notebooks so people can view our work.
•
• Types of modes in Jupyter:
Jupyter is in edit mode whenever we type in a cell — a small pencil icon appears to the
right of the menu bar.
•
Jupyter is in function mode whenever we press Esc or whenever we click outside of the
cell — the pencil to the right of the menu bar disappears.
